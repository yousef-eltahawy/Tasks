- before runing the project you should download postgres database
	-create new user and password 
	-create database with name tasks as per application.properties file
	- link for postgres :https://sbp.enterprisedb.com/getfile.jsp?fileid=1258895

- project runing on java 17 

- I'm using the local server for caching for testing purpose but it isn't a recomanded way for production
  it should be caching server like (redis).

- this is google account for testing purpose:
	email : testusert835@gmail.com
	password : testtest_22
  You can open this account to check the created events, and if you 
  want to use a different account, you should contact me.

- There are credentials and token files for authentication.
  You must not change them.

- I didn't create the test folder, because there is a better way 
 to check my APIs and to test them Manually when running the code.
  
  you can use this link from post man to check my APIs:
